# philanthropic-cocktails
Cant figure out what to drink? Want to search by specific ingredients? This web app was designed to make it easy for users not only to search, but also follow instuctions to create a quality cocktail. The users slected drink will be saved in local storage and appear on the left side of the page. Just incase the user would like to go back and make it again. Dont forget to donate!! aside from cocktails we also care about our environment. We have added a donation button that gives you a list to contribute to any of your choosing. What makes our project stand out? Unlike going to your local library for a book we make it quick and easy to gather information on ingredients. Not only what you need but also including a "how to" in case you get lost.
