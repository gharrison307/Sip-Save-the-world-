# philanthropic-cocktails

Can't figure out what to drink? Want to search for specific ingredients? This web app was designed to make it easy for users not only to search, but also follow instructions to create a quality cocktail. The user's selected drink will be saved in local storage and appear on the left side of the page. Just in case the user would like to go back and make it again. Don't forget to donate!! Aside from cocktails we also care about our environment. We have added a donation button that gives you a list to contribute to any of your choosing. What makes our project stand out? Unlike going to your local library for a book we make it quick and easy to gather information on ingredients. Not only what you need but also including a "how to" in case you get lost.

## Installation

Our project is a web based application that runs in the browser. No downloading or installaion required. 

## Usage

Users are greeted with the option to search by alcoholic and non-alcoholic and then by cocktail name or ingredient. Cocktail names will bring you specific lists of cocktails while ingredients will provide any drink that may contain your search querry.

Once something has been searched, a list of the possible cocktails or ingredients will populate for the user to click on.

When a drink in the list has been selected, the main card will populate with a list of ingredients and the amounts required to make the drink as well as an image of what the drink should look like.

If users wish to look back at a previously searched drink, they can find them located in the saved drinks bar. Clicking a drink will repopulate to see the recipe and image.

Users will also be presented with a donate button at the top of the page and on every card. When clicked on, a charity choice can be selected that will pull up a variety based on that keyword. Users are then directed to a given charity's website if it is selected.
